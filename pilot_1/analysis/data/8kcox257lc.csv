        </div>
        <p>We are investigating how conversations can increase Americans' willingness to discuss highly disputed topics. </p>
        <p>Some existing research has examined the effects of different types of human to human conversations on this willingness, and we would like to explore these dynamics when one of the conversational partners is a chatbot. </p>
        <p> By participating in our experiment, you have helped us learn more about these effects. </p>
        <p> You were randomly assigned to either converse with a chatbot or freely reflect on your topic. If you spoke with a chatbot, you randomly experienced one of three different types of dialogue. </p>
