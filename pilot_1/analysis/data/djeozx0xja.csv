It is crucial to ensure that any subsidy program is sustainable and effectively manages supply and demand dynamics.\n\nAdditionally, while providing a year of maternity leave may indeed reduce the need for infant childcare in the short term, it does not address the long-term challenges of childcare costs and workforce participation.
