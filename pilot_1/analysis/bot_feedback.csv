Especially in the South where I was raised and still live, it's a topic that has caused division in my family. I typically choose to avoid conflict because I realize that some people are against it simply because that's how they were taught. I think they are ignorant if they aren't willing to open their minds, but don't necessarily hold it against them either. I don't like to argue, so I'm not going to willingly jump into a discussion where I know someone believes the opposite from me. I'm ok with everyone holding their own beliefs.
