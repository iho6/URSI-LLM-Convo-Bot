I doubt the \""government\"" should be involved at all, since nothing they do work well.  Failed oversight over private prisons is a different problem that must be rectified.  Too many institutions that provide food, training, clothing, medical, drugs, etc. (including the legal system)...anywhere money can flow in from, are the problem.  \n\n""}","control-intervention","control free reflection",11.3088833333333
"6640f177729428aa56c73cb4","{""control-free-response"":""Yes. I agree with this statement. In prison sentences are extreme. This should be exclusively saved for extreme situations. The crimes aren't violent. And therefore, societal safety has not proven to be at risk by the criminal. In prison punishments are more expensive too. This costs society. This costs the prisoner and the network connected to that prisoner (children, spouse, family, employers, etc.). Additionally, In prison sentences could back fire. The extreme punishment could exasturbate whatever caused the criminal activity in the first place. If a person stole something because they are poor, a in person prison sentence only makes that worse. And that sentence only desensitizes that person to violence - making them more likely to recidivate. ""}","control-intervention","control free reflection",16.42015
